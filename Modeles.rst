Keyword Extraction Model:
--------------------------------
For the keyword extraction task, we use the Zephyr 7B Beta model provided by Hugging Face. 
This is a powerful instruction-tuned large language model designed for high-performance NLP tasks.

The model was fine-tuned on a custom dataset specifically designed for the keyword extraction 
use case. Each training example consists of:

**An input prompt:** representing a user query; Preceded by a directive prompt to guide the model during fine-tuning,

**An output:** consisting of the list of objects (or keywords) mentioned in the prompt.

This fine-tuning approach allows the model to learn how to identify 
and extract relevant objects regardless of the promptâ€™s structure, wording, 
or semantic style. After training, the Zephyr model is capable of handling diverse 
user instructions and reliably returning the corresponding keywords, making it a robust component 
for real-world prompt interpretation in image segmentation tasks.
